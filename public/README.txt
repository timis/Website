My game supports buying "powerups" and has different types of enemies. Shooting enemies
earns you credits, which can be exchanged for the powerups by clicking on that powerup 
on the right side of the canvas. Powerups include More Shots/Second, More Damage/Shot, 
More Shot Penetration (the more enemies a shot can hit), and More Player Speed. Enemies
come in various speeds. They also receive a random health, so some enemies are stronger
than others. Over time, the max health does cap out. Over time, enemies will become faster
and more will be spawned per second.
